Subject: [PATCH 444/777] media: intel-ipu3: Align struct
 ipu3_uapi_awb_fr_config_s to 32 bytes

[ Upstream commit ce644cf3fa06504c2c71ab1b794160d54aaccbc0 ]

A struct that needs to be aligned to 32 bytes has a size of 28. Increase
the size to 32.

This makes elements of arrays of this struct aligned to 32 as well, and
other structs where members are aligned to 32 mixing
ipu3_uapi_awb_fr_config_s as well as other types.

Fixes: commit dca5ef2aa1e6 ("media: staging/intel-ipu3: remove the unnecessary compiler flags")
