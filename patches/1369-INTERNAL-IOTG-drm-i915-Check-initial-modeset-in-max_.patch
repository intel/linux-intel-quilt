Subject: [PATCH 1369/2313] INTERNAL [IOTG] drm/i915: Check initial modeset in
 max_available_pipes

During testing of the planes restriction feature, it was discovered that
the series would fail to boot under LaaG and AaaG. Vivek offered this
commit as a fix. With this commit, AaaG will boot to GFX without
initial modeset being passed to the kernel.


This was also tested to work on AaaG and LaaG with these changs to
the command line paramaters:
i915.enable_initial_modeset=1 and i915.avail_planes_per_pipe=0x000C00

Fixes: faa158d ("INTERNAL [IOTG] drm/i915: Introduce the Plane Restriction feature")
