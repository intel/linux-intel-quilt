Subject: [PATCH 2210/2278] x86/intel_rdt: Create required perf event
 attributes

A perf event has many attributes that are maintained in a separate
structure that should be provided when a new perf_event is created.

In preparation for the transition to perf_events the required attribute
structures are created for all the events that may be used in the
measurements. Most attributes for all the events are identical. The
actual configuration, what specifies what needs to be measured, is what
will be different between the events used. This configuration needs to
be done with X86_CONFIG that cannot be used as part of the designated
initializers used here, this will be introduced later.

Although they do look identical at this time the attribute structures
needs to be maintained separately since a perf_event will maintain a
pointer to its unique attributes.

In support of patch testing the new structs are given the unused attribute
until their use in later patches.
