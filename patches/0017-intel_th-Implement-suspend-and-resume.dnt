Subject: [PATCH 17/63] intel_th: Implement suspend and resume

Intel Trace Hub does not need to do anything when going to suspend.

When going to low power or suspending, firmwares will take care of
saving its current state, stopping the current trace and powering it
down.

When coming out of low power or suspend, firmwares will take care of
powering it up restoring its state and resuming the current trace.

The driver still needs to implement the suspend and resume calls so that
the kernel does not disable memory access by setting BME=0 in its PCI
config space before the firmwares do the proper shut down of the Trace
Hub.
