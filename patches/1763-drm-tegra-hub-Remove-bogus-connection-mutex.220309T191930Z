Subject: [PATCH 1763/4530] drm/tegra: hub: Remove bogus connection mutex check

The Tegra DRM never actually took that lock, so the driver was broken
until generic locking was added in commit:

	commit b962a12050a387e4bbf3a48745afe1d29d396b0d
	Author: Rob Clark <robdclark@gmail.com>

	    drm/atomic: integrate modeset lock with private objects

It's now no longer necessary to take that lock, so drop the check.

v2: add rationale for why it is now safe to drop the check (Daniel)
