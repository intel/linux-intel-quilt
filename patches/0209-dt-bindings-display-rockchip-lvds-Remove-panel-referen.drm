Subject: [PATCH 0209/1606] dt-bindings: display: rockchip-lvds: Remove panel
 references
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The panel bindings are outside the scope of the Rockchip LVDS interface
binding. The references are about to change too, so rather than update
them just drop the section on the panel bindings.
