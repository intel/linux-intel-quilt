Subject: [PATCH 2147/2278] x86/intel_rdt/mba_sc: Documentation for MBA
 software controller(mba_sc)

Add documentation about the feedback loop mechanism (MBA software
controller) which lets the user specify the memory bandwidth allocation
in MBps. This includes some changes to "schemata" formati with
examples.

+low bandwidth. The fact that Memory bandwidth allocation(MBA) is a core
+specific mechanism where as memory bandwidth monitoring(MBM) is done at
+the package level may lead to confusion when users try to apply control
+via the MBA and then monitor the bandwidth to see if the controls are
+effective. Below are such scenarios:
+
+1. User may *not* see increase in actual bandwidth when percentage
+   values are increased:
+
+This can occur when aggregate L2 external bandwidth is more than L3
+external bandwidth. Consider an SKL SKU with 24 cores on a package and
+where L2 external  is 10GBps (hence aggregate L2 external bandwidth is
+240GBps) and L3 external bandwidth is 100GBps. Now a workload with '20
+threads, having 50% bandwidth, each consuming 5GBps' consumes the max L3
+bandwidth of 100GBps although the percentage value specified is only 50%
+<< 100%. Hence increasing the bandwidth percentage will not yeild any
+more bandwidth. This is because although the L2 external bandwidth still
+has capacity, the L3 external bandwidth is fully used. Also note that
+this would be dependent on number of cores the benchmark is run on.
+
+2. Same bandwidth percentage may mean different actual bandwidth
+   depending on # of threads:
+
+For the same SKU in #1, a 'single thread, with 10% bandwidth' and '4
+thread, with 10% bandwidth' can consume upto 10GBps and 40GBps although
+they have same percentage bandwidth of 10%. This is simply because as
+threads start using more cores in an rdtgroup, the actual bandwidth may
+increase or vary although user specified bandwidth percentage is same.
+
+In order to mitigate this and make the interface more user friendly,
+resctrl added support for specifying the bandwidth in MBps as well.  The
+kernel underneath would use a software feedback mechanism or a "Software
+Controller(mba_sc)" which reads the actual bandwidth using MBM counters
+and adjust the memowy bandwidth percentages to ensure
+
+	"actual bandwidth < user specified bandwidth".
+
+By default, the schemata would take the bandwidth percentage values
+where as user can switch to the "MBA software controller" mode using
+a mount option 'mba_MBps'. The schemata format is specified in the below
+sections.
