Subject: [PATCH 1222/1606] dma-buf: fix busy wait for new shared fences
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When reservation_object_add_shared_fence is replacing an old fence with a new
one we should not drop the old one before the new one is in place.

Otherwise other cores can busy wait for the new one to appear.
