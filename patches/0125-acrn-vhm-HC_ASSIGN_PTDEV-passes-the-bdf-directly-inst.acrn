Subject: [PATCH 125/144] acrn/vhm: HC_ASSIGN_PTDEV passes the bdf directly
 instead of guest physical address

Currently the HC_ASSIGN/DEASSIGN_PTDEV is called to add/remove the
pass-through device and the bdf is passed by using guest_physical_addr
mode. This requires that the ACRN hypervisor looks up the GPA mapping
to get the bdf. In fact it looks much simpler that it is passed directly.
