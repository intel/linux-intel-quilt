Subject: [PATCH 81/99] x86/mm: x86/sgx: Signal SIGSEGV with PF_SGX

The x86 architecture has a set of page fault error codes.  These indicate
things like whether the fault occurred from a write, or whether it
originated in userspace.

The SGX hardware architecture has its own per-page memory management
metadata (EPCM) [*] and hardware which is separate from the normal x86 MMU.
The architecture has a new page fault error code: PF_SGX.  This new error
code bit is set whenever a page fault occurs as the result of the SGX MMU.

These faults occur for a variety of reasons.  For instance, an access
attempt to enclave memory from outside the enclave causes a PF_SGX fault.
PF_SGX would also be set for permission conflicts, such as if a write to an
enclave page occurs and the page is marked read-write in the x86 page
tables but is read-only in the EPCM.

These faults do not always indicate errors, though.  SGX pages are
encrypted with a key that is destroyed at hardware reset, including
suspend. Throwing a SIGSEGV allows user space software to react and recover
when these events occur.

Include PF_SGX in the PF error codes list and throw SIGSEGV when it is
encountered.
