Subject: [PATCH 1224/1606] drm/i915: Drop expectations of VM_IO from our GGTT
 mmappings

We don't really want to use VM_IO for our GGTT mmaps (it implies that
the mmap contains memory mapped registers, which we do not expose) yet I
overzealously added it to an assert just because that's how we always
had setup the vma.
