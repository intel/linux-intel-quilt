Subject: [PATCH 31/62] kernel: printk: move some definition out of config
 scope to avoid build error

These definitions previously put in #ifdef CONFIG_PRINTK, this config is defined as default
however, if you build code with allnoconfig, you will find this error, change it to out of #ifdef
to avoid this error.
