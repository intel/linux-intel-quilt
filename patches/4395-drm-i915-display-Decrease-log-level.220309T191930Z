Subject: [PATCH 4395/4530] drm/i915/display: Decrease log level
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Converting error to debug print if sink fails to configure scrambling or
TMDS bit clock ratio. In this case, we are timing out while disabling
the scrambling and setting the SCDC ratio, as there is no response
to the I2C SCDC write from the sink device. Error isn't due to something
wrong done from driver side.
