Subject: [PATCH 03/78] x86/mm: x86/sgx: Signal SIGSEGV with PF_SGX

Include SGX bit to the PF error codes and throw SIGSEGV with PF_SGX when
a #PF with SGX set happens.

CPU throws a #PF with the SGX set in the event of Enclave Page Cache Map
(EPCM) conflict. The EPCM is a CPU-internal table, which describes the
properties for a enclave page. Enclaves are measured and signed software
entities, which SGX hosts. [1]

Although the primary purpose of the EPCM conflict checks  is to prevent
malicious accesses to an enclave, an illegit access can happen also for
legit reasons.

All SGX reserved memory, including EPCM is encrypted with a transient key
that does not survive from the power transition. Throwing a SIGSEGV allows
user space software to react when this happens (e.g. recreate the enclave,
which was invalidated).
