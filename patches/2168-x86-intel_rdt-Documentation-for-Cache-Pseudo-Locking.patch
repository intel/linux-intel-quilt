+Cache Pseudo-Locking
+--------------------
+CAT enables a user to specify the amount of cache space that an
+application can fill. Cache pseudo-locking builds on the fact that a
+CPU can still read and write data pre-allocated outside its current
+allocated area on a cache hit. With cache pseudo-locking, data can be
+preloaded into a reserved portion of cache that no application can
+fill, and from that point on will only serve cache hits. The cache
+pseudo-locked memory is made accessible to user space where an
+application can map it into its virtual address space and thus have
+a region of memory with reduced average read latency.
+
+The creation of a cache pseudo-locked region is triggered by a request
+from the user to do so that is accompanied by a schemata of the region
+to be pseudo-locked. The cache pseudo-locked region is created as follows:
+- Create a CAT allocation CLOSNEW with a CBM matching the schemata
+  from the user of the cache region that will contain the pseudo-locked
+  memory. This region must not overlap with any current CAT allocation/CLOS
+  on the system and no future overlap with this cache region is allowed
+  while the pseudo-locked region exists.
+- Create a contiguous region of memory of the same size as the cache
+  region.
+- Flush the cache, disable hardware prefetchers, disable preemption.
+- Make CLOSNEW the active CLOS and touch the allocated memory to load
+  it into the cache.
+- Set the previous CLOS as active.
+- At this point the closid CLOSNEW can be released - the cache
+  pseudo-locked region is protected as long as its CBM does not appear in
+  any CAT allocation. Even though the cache pseudo-locked region will from
+  this point on not appear in any CBM of any CLOS an application running with
+  any CLOS will be able to access the memory in the pseudo-locked region since
+  the region continues to serve cache hits.
+- The contiguous region of memory loaded into the cache is exposed to
+  user-space as a character device.
+
+Cache pseudo-locking increases the probability that data will remain
+in the cache via carefully configuring the CAT feature and controlling
+application behavior. There is no guarantee that data is placed in
+cache. Instructions like INVD, WBINVD, CLFLUSH, etc. can still evict
+“locked” data from cache. Power management C-states may shrink or
+power off cache. It is thus recommended to limit the processor maximum
+C-state, for example, by setting the processor.max_cstate kernel parameter.
+
+It is required that an application using a pseudo-locked region runs
+with affinity to the cores (or a subset of the cores) associated
+with the cache on which the pseudo-locked region resides. A sanity check
+within the code will not allow an application to map pseudo-locked memory
+unless it runs with affinity to cores associated with the cache on which the
+pseudo-locked region resides. The sanity check is only done during the
+initial mmap() handling, there is no enforcement afterwards and the
+application self needs to ensure it remains affine to the correct cores.
+
+Pseudo-locking is accomplished in two stages:
+1) During the first stage the system administrator allocates a portion
+   of cache that should be dedicated to pseudo-locking. At this time an
+   equivalent portion of memory is allocated, loaded into allocated
+   cache portion, and exposed as a character device.
+2) During the second stage a user-space application maps (mmap()) the
+   pseudo-locked memory into its address space.
+
+Cache Pseudo-Locking Interface
+------------------------------
+A pseudo-locked region is created using the resctrl interface as follows:
+
+1) Create a new resource group by creating a new directory in /sys/fs/resctrl.
+2) Change the new resource group's mode to "pseudo-locksetup" by writing
+   "pseudo-locksetup" to the "mode" file.
+3) Write the schemata of the pseudo-locked region to the "schemata" file. All
+   bits within the schemata should be "unused" according to the "bit_usage"
+   file.
+
+On successful pseudo-locked region creation the "mode" file will contain
+"pseudo-locked" and a new character device with the same name as the resource
+group will exist in /dev/pseudo_lock. This character device can be mmap()'ed
+by user space in order to obtain access to the pseudo-locked memory region.
+
+An example of cache pseudo-locked region creation and usage can be found below.
+
+Cache Pseudo-Locking Debugging Interface
+---------------------------------------
+The pseudo-locking debugging interface is enabled by default (if
+CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is enabled) and can be found in /sys/kernel/debug/resctrl.
+
+There is no explicit way for the kernel to test if a provided memory
+location is present in the cache. The pseudo-locking debugging interface uses
+the tracing infrastructure to provide two ways to measure cache residency of
+the pseudo-locked region:
+1) Memory access latency using the pseudo_lock_mem_latency tracepoint. Data
+   from these measurements are best visualized using a hist trigger (see
+   example below). In this test the pseudo-locked region is traversed at
+   a stride of 32 bytes while hardware prefetchers and preemption
+   are disabled. This also provides a substitute visualization of cache
+   hits and misses.
+2) Cache hit and miss measurements using model specific precision counters if
+   available. Depending on the levels of cache on the system the pseudo_lock_l2
+   and pseudo_lock_l3 tracepoints are available.
+   WARNING: triggering this  measurement uses from two (for just L2
+   measurements) to four (for L2 and L3 measurements) precision counters on
+   the system, if any other measurements are in progress the counters and
+   their corresponding event registers will be clobbered.
+
+When a pseudo-locked region is created a new debugfs directory is created for
+it in debugfs as /sys/kernel/debug/resctrl/<newdir>. A single
+write-only file, pseudo_lock_measure, is present in this directory. The
+measurement on the pseudo-locked region depends on the number, 1 or 2,
+written to this debugfs file. Since the measurements are recorded with the
+tracing infrastructure the relevant tracepoints need to be enabled before the
+measurement is triggered.
+
+Example of latency debugging interface:
+In this example a pseudo-locked region named "newlock" was created. Here is
+how we can measure the latency in cycles of reading from this region and
+visualize this data with a histogram that is available if CONFIG_HIST_TRIGGERS
+is set:
+# :> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
+# echo 'hist:keys=latency' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/resctrl/pseudo_lock_mem_latency/trigger

+Example of cache hits/misses debugging:
+In this example a pseudo-locked region named "newlock" was created on the L2
+cache of a platform. Here is how we can obtain details of the cache hits
+and misses using the platform's precision counters.
