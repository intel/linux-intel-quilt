Subject: [PATCH 1264/1606] drm/i915/selftests: Fixup a missing legacy_idx

Grr, missed one*. For using the legacy engine map, we should use
engine->legacy_idx. Ideally, we should know the intel_context in the
selftest and avoid all the fiddling around with unwanted GEM contexts.

* In my defence, the conflict was added in another patch after it was
tested by CI.

v2: mock engines needs legacy love as well

Fixes: f1c4d157ab9b ("drm/i915: Fix up the inverse mapping for default ctx->engines[]")
