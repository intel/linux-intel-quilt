Subject: [PATCH 3941/4530] drm/i915/gt: Report the currently active execlists
 request

Since commit 22b7a426bbe1 ("drm/i915/execlists: Preempt-to-busy"), we
prune the engine->active.requests list prior to preemption, thus
removing the trace of the currently executing request. If that request
hangs rather than be preempted, we conclude that no active request was
on the GPU. Fortunately, this only impacts our debugging, and not our
means of hang detection or recovery.

v2: Use from to check the current iterator before continuing, and report
active as NULL if the current request is already completed.
