Subject: [PATCH 0414/4530] drm/amd/display: Rebuild mapped resources after
 pipe split

[why]
The issue is specific for linux, as on timings such as 8K@60
or 4K@144 DSC should be working in combination with ODM Combine
in order to ensure that we can run those timings. The validation
for those timings was passing, but when pipe split was happening
second pipe wasn't being programmed.

[how]
Rebuild mapped resources if we split stream for ODM.
