Subject: [PATCH 683/777] samples/bpf: Fix broken xdp_rxq_info due to map order
 assumptions

commit edbca120a8cdfa5a5793707e33497aa5185875ca upstream.

In the days of using bpf_load.c the order in which the 'maps' sections
were defines in BPF side (*_kern.c) file, were used by userspace side
to identify the map via using the map order as an index. In effect the
order-index is created based on the order the maps sections are stored
in the ELF-object file, by the LLVM compiler.

This have also carried over in libbpf via API bpf_map__next(NULL, obj)
to extract maps in the order libbpf parsed the ELF-object file.

When BTF based maps were introduced a new section type ".maps" were
created. I found that the LLVM compiler doesn't create the ".maps"
sections in the order they are defined in the C-file. The order in the
ELF file is based on the order the map pointer is referenced in the code.

This combination of changes lead to xdp_rxq_info mixing up the map
file-descriptors in userspace, resulting in very broken behaviour, but
without warning the user.

This patch fix issue by instead using bpf_object__find_map_by_name()
to find maps via their names. (Note, this is the ELF name, which can
be longer than the name the kernel retains).

Fixes: be5bca44aa6b ("samples: bpf: convert some XDP samples from bpf_load to libbpf")
Fixes: 451d1dc886b5 ("samples: bpf: update map definition to new syntax BTF-defined map")
