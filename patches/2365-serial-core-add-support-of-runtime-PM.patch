Subject: [PATCH 2365/2367] serial: core: add support of runtime PM

8250 driver has wrong implementation of runtime PM, e.g. it uses an irq_safe
flag. This patch adds runtime PM calls to serial core once for all UART
drivers.

The drivers without runtime PM support will not change behaviour. The rest has
been prepared already. Thus, we are on the safe side to make a change right
now.
