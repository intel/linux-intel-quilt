Subject: [PATCH 1476/2302] xhci: Add option to get next extended capability in
 list by passing id = 0

Modify xhci_find_next_ext_cap(base, offset, id) to return the next
capability offset if 0 is passed for id. Otherwise it will behave as
previously and return the offset of the next capability with matching id

capability id 0 is not used by xHCI (reserved)

This is useful when we want to loop through all capabilities.
