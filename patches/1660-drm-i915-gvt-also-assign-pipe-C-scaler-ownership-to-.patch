Subject: [PATCH 1660/1667] drm/i915/gvt: also assign pipe C scaler ownership
 to UOS 1

Currently we mainly support one SOS and one UOS, there is usr case that
SOS displays on pipe A, UOS displays video with clone mode on pipe B and C,
if pipe C scaler ownership is not assigned to UOS 1, video on pipe C can
only be displayed with source size on the top-left side of screen.
