Subject: [PATCH 065/370] drm/i915: Disable SAMPLER_STATE prefetching on all
 Gen11 steppings.

The Demand Prefetch workaround (binding table prefetching) only applies
to Icelake A0/B0.  But the Sampler Prefetch workaround needs to be
applied to all Gen11 steppings, according to a programming note in the
SARCHKMD documentation.

Using the Intel Gallium driver, I have seen intermittent failures in
the dEQP-GLES31.functional.copy_image.non_compressed.* tests.  After
applying this workaround, the tests reliably pass.

v2: Remove the overlap with a pre-production w/a
