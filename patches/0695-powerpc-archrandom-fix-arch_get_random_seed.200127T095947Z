Subject: [PATCH 695/777] powerpc/archrandom: fix arch_get_random_seed_int()

commit b6afd1234cf93aa0d71b4be4788c47534905f0be upstream.

Commit 01c9348c7620ec65

  powerpc: Use hardware RNG for arch_get_random_seed_* not arch_get_random_*

updated arch_get_random_[int|long]() to be NOPs, and moved the hardware
RNG backing to arch_get_random_seed_[int|long]() instead. However, it
failed to take into account that arch_get_random_int() was implemented
in terms of arch_get_random_long(), and so we ended up with a version
of the former that is essentially a NOP as well.

Fix this by calling arch_get_random_seed_long() from
arch_get_random_seed_int() instead.
