Subject: [PATCH 0387/1240] mfd: intel-lpss: Avoid resuming runtime-suspended
 lpss unnecessarily

We have report that the intel_lpss_prepare() takes too much time during
suspend, and this is because we first resume the devices from runtime
suspend by resume_lpss_device(), to make sure they are in proper state
before system suspend, which takes 100ms for each LPSS devices(PCI power
state from D3_cold to D0). And since resume_lpss_device() resumes the
devices synchronously, we might get huge latency if we have many
LPSS devices.

So first try is to use pm_request_resume() instead, to make the runtime
resume process asynchronously. Unfortunately the asynchronous runtime
resume relies on pm_wq, which is freezed at early stage. So we choose
another method, that is to avoid resuming runtime-suspended devices,
if they are already runtime suspended. This is safe because for LPSS
driver, the runtime suspend and system suspend are of the same
hook - i.e., intel_lpss_suspend(). And moreover, this device is
neither runtime wakeup source nor system wakeup source.
