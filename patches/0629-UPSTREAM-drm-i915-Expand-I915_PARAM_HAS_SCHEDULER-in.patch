Subject: [PATCH 0629/1240] UPSTREAM: drm/i915: Expand I915_PARAM_HAS_SCHEDULER
 into a capability bitmask

In the next few patches, we wish to enable different features for the
scheduler, some which may subtlety change ABI (e.g. allow requests to be
reordered under different circumstances). So we need to make sure
userspace is cognizant of the changes (if they care), by which we employ
the usual method of a GETPARAM. We already have an
I915_PARAM_HAS_SCHEDULER (which notes the existing ability to reorder
requests to avoid bubbles), and now we wish to extend that to be a
bitmask to describe the different capabilities implemented.
