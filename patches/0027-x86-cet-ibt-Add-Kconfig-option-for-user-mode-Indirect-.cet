Subject: [PATCH 27/37] x86/cet/ibt: Add Kconfig option for user-mode Indirect
 Branch Tracking

Introduce Kconfig option X86_BRANCH_TRACKING_USER.

Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT) provides protection against CALL-/JMP-
oriented programming attacks.  It is active when the kernel has this
feature enabled, and the processor and the application support it.
When this feature is enabled, legacy non-IBT applications continue to
work, but without IBT protection.
