Subject: [PATCH 2619/4530] drm/i915/display: Do not check for the ddb
 allocations of turned off pipes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It should not care about DDB allocations of pipes going through
a fullmodeset, as at this point those pipes are disabled.
The comment in the code also points to that but that was not what
was being executed.
