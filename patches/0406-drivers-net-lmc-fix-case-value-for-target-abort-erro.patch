Subject: [PATCH 0406/2156] drivers: net: lmc: fix case value for target abort
 error

[ Upstream commit afb41bb039656f0cecb54eeb8b2e2088201295f5 ]

Current value for a target abort error is 0x010, however, this value
should in fact be 0x002.  As it stands, the range of error is 0..7 so
it is currently never being detected.  This bug has been in the driver
since the early 2.6.12 days (or before).

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#744290 ("Logically dead code")
