Subject: [PATCH 336/777] Documentation/ABI: Fix documentation inconsistency
 for mlxreg-io sysfs interfaces

commit f4094826779dcafe7087e80850513b923eeefdeb upstream.

Fix attribute name from "jtag_enable", which described twice to
"cpld3_version", which is expected to be instead of second appearance
of "jtag_enable".

Fixes: 2752e34442b5 ("Documentation/ABI: Add new attribute for mlxreg-io sysfs interfaces")
