Subject: [PATCH 0925/1240] [FROMLIST] drm/i915/execlists: Flush pending
 preemption events during reset
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Catch up with the inflight CSB events, after disabling the tasklet
before deciding which request was truly guilty of hanging the GPU.

Modification required:
The original patch dropped the loop on CSB processing upon refactoring
out the code. The loop may not be necessary as we expect a new irq to
kick a new tasklet. But let's not hide that change in a refactoring,
and let's not take a chance with it right now. This was given as a
review comment but not yet incorporated.

Modification required:
We now do a final CSB process prior to the pending reset, but we
don't attempt to dequeue new requests if the engine was found
idle. Rightly so. We don't want to start a new request on the engine
just to reset it. Instead we abort the pending reset. However we
must kick the tasklet so that a dequeue will happen upon exit of
the reset code. This was given as a review comment but not yet
incorporated.
