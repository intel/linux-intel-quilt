Subject: [PATCH 0094/2156] ALSA: hda - Turn CX8200 into D3 as well upon reboot

commit d77a4b4a5b0b2ebcbc9840995d91311ef28302ab upstream.

As an equivalent codec with CX20724,
CX8200 is also subject to the reboot bug.

Late 2017 and 2018 LG Gram and some HP Spectre laptops are known victims
to this issue, causing extremely loud noises upon reboot.

Now that we know that this bug is subject to multiple codecs,
fix the comment as well.
