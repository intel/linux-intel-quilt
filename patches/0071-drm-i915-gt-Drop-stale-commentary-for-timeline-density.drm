Subject: [PATCH 071/408] drm/i915/gt: Drop stale commentary for timeline
 density

We no longer allocate a contiguous set of timeline ids for all engines
upon creation, so we no longer should assume that the timelines are
densely allocated within a context. Hopefully, the set of fences used
within a workload are still dense enough for us to take advantage of
the compressed radix tree used for the syncmap.
