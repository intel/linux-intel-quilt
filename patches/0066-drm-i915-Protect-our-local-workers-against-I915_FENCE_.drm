Subject: [PATCH 066/690] drm/i915: Protect our local workers against
 I915_FENCE_TIMEOUT

Trust our own workers to not cause unnecessary delays and disable the
automatic timeout on their asynchronous fence waits. (Along the same
lines that we trust our own requests to complete eventually, if
necessary by force.)
