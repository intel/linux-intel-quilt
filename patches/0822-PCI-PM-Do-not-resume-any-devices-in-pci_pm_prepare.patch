Subject: [PATCH 0822/2367] PCI / PM: Do not resume any devices in
 pci_pm_prepare()

It should not be necessary to resume devices with ignore_children set
in pci_pm_prepare(), because they should be resumed explicitly by
their children drivers during suspend if need be and they will be
resumed by pci_pm_suspend() after that anyway, so avoid doing that.
