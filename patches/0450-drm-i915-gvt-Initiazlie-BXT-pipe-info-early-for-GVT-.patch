Subject: [PATCH 0450/1240] drm/i915/gvt: Initiazlie BXT pipe info early for
 GVT-g

GVT will utilize the num_sprite to initialize the mmio info, but
num_sprite is initialized later than GVT initialization, so move
the pipe info earlier.

This patch can fix some uninitialized mmio in different planes.
