Subject: [PATCH 638/777] ARM: dts: dra7: fix cpsw mdio fck clock

commit 6af0a549c25e0d02366aa95507bfe3cad2f7b68b upstream.

The DRA7 CPSW MDIO functional clock (gmac_clkctrl DRA7_GMAC_GMAC_CLKCTRL 0)
is specified incorrectly, which is caused incorrect MDIO bus clock
configuration MDCLK. The correct CPSW MDIO functional clock is
gmac_main_clk (125MHz), which is the same as CPSW fck. Hence fix it.

Fixes: 1faa415c9c6e ("ARM: dts: Add fck for cpsw mdio for omap variants")
