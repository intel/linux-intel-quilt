Subject: [PATCH 0866/4530] drm/komeda: remove redundant assignment to pointer
 disable_done

The pointer disable_done is being initialized with a value that
is never read and is being re-assigned a little later on. The
assignment is redundant and hence can be removed.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
