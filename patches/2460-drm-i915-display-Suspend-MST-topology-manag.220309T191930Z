Subject: [PATCH 2460/4530] drm/i915/display: Suspend MST topology manager
 before destroy fbdev
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

MST topology needs to be suspended so we don't have any calls to
fbdev after it's finalized. MST will be destroyed later as part of
drm_mode_config_cleanup().
