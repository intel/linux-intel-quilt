Subject: [PATCH 260/530] drm/i915: Mark semaphores as complete on unsubmit out
 if payload was started

Avoid charging us for the presumed busywait if the request was preempted
after successfully using semaphores to reduce inter-engine latency.

v2: Bump the priority to reflect the lack of semaphores now required.
