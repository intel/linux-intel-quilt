Subject: [PATCH 164/190] hyper_dmabuf: Remove void* cast in cpu_access
 function pointers

In dma_buf_ops structure init, hyper_dmabuf_ops_begin_cpu_access() and
hyper_dmabuf_ops_end_cpu_access() functions are of same type as
begin_cpu_access() and end_cpu_access() function declartions. So there
is no need for casting them with void*.
