Subject: [PATCH 0921/1240] [UPSTREAM] drm/i915: Only call tasklet_kill() on
 the first prepare_reset

tasklet_kill() will spin waiting for the current tasklet to be executed.
However, if tasklet_disable() has been called, then the tasklet is never
executed but permanently put back onto the runlist until
tasklet_enable() is called. Ergo, we cannot use tasklet_kill() inside a
disable/enable pair. This is the case when we call set-wedge from inside
i915_reset(), and another request was submitted to us concurrent to the
reset.

Fixes: 963ddd63c314 ("drm/i915: Suspend submission tasklets around wedging")
