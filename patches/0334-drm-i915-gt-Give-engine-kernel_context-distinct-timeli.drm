Subject: [PATCH 334/367] drm/i915/gt: Give engine->kernel_context distinct
 timeline lock classes

Assign a separate lockclass to the perma-pinned timelines of the
kernel_context, such that we can use them from within the user timelines
should we ever need to inject GPU operations to fixup faults during
request construction.
