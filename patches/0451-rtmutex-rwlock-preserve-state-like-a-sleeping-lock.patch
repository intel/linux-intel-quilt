Subject: [PATCH 0451/2302] rtmutex/rwlock: preserve state like a sleeping lock

[ Upstream commit 4a1bf9e54a013d55ab156cb462c68054cb52ee2d ]

The rwlock is spinning while acquiring a lock. Therefore it must become
a sleeping lock on RT and preserve its task state while sleeping and
waiting for the lock to become available.
