Subject: [PATCH 1363/1606] ASoC: SOF: Refine some IPC data structures to make
 its size 4bytes aligned

Host communicates with dsp by sending or receiving data in memory
windows which are in PCI MMIO space. Some platforms like ICL require
the transaction size is 4bytes aligned. So it is better to make the
data size 4bytes aligned to make it work on all platforms.
