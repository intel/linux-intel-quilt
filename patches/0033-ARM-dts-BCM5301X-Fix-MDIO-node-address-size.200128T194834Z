Subject: [PATCH 033/777] ARM: dts: BCM5301X: Fix MDIO node address/size cells

[ Upstream commit 093c3f94e922d83a734fc4da08cc5814990f32c6 ]

The MDIO node on BCM5301X had an reversed #address-cells and
 #size-cells properties, correct those, silencing checker warnings:

.../linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm4708-asus-rt-ac56u.dt.yaml: mdio@18003000: #address-cells:0:0: 1 was expected
