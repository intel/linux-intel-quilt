Subject: [PATCH 19/53] KVM: x86: Allow FRED/LKGS to be advertised to guests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Allow FRED/LKGS to be advertised to guests after changes required to
enable FRED in a KVM guest are in place.

LKGS is introduced with FRED to completely eliminate the need to swapgs
explicilty, because

1) FRED transitions ensure that an operating system can always operate
   with its own GS base address.

2) LKGS behaves like the MOV to GS instruction except that it loads
   the base address into the IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE MSR instead of the
   GS segmentâ€™s descriptor cache, which is exactly what Linux kernel
   does to load a user level GS base.  Thus there is no need to SWAPGS
   away from the kernel GS base and an execution of SWAPGS causes #UD
   if FRED transitions are enabled.

A FRED CPU must enumerate LKGS.  When LKGS is not available, FRED must
not be enabled.
