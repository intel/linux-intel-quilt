Subject: [PATCH 44/45] perf x86/topdown: Fix topdown leader sampling test
 error on hybrid

When running topdown leader smapling test on Intel hybrid platforms,
such as LNL/ARL, we see the below error.

Topdown leader sampling test
Topdown leader sampling [Failed topdown events not reordered correctly]

It indciates the below command fails.

perf record -o "${perfdata}" -e "{instructions,slots,topdown-retiring}:S" true

The root cause is that perf tool creats a perf event for each PMU type
if it can create.

As for this command, there would be 5 perf events created,
cpu_atom/instructions/,cpu_atom/topdown_retiring/,
cpu_core/slots/,cpu_core/instructions/,cpu_core/topdown-retiring/

For these 5 events, the 2 cpu_atom events are in a group and the other 3
cpu_core events are in another group.

When arch_topdown_sample_read() traverses all these 5 events, events
cpu_atom/instructions/ and cpu_core/slots/ don't have a same group
leade, and then return false directly and lead to cpu_core/slots/ event
is used to sample and this is not allowed by PMU driver.

It's a overkill to return false directly if "evsel->core.leader !=
 leader->core.leader" since there could be multiple groups in the event
list.

Just "continue" instead of "return false" to fix this issue.
