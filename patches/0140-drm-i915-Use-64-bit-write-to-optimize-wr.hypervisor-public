Subject: [PATCH 140/190] drm/i915: Use 64-bit write to optimize writing
 fence_reg

On VGPU scenario the read/write operation of fence_reg will be trapped
by the GVT-g. Then gvt-g follows the HW spec to program the fence_reg.
And the gvt-g takes care of updating the fence reg correctly for any trapped
value of fence reg.

So it is unnecessary to read/write fence reg several times. It is enough that
the fence reg is written only value in 64-bit mode. This will help
to reduce the redundant trap of fence_reg mmio operation.

V1->V2: Add back the condition judgement of !pipelined
