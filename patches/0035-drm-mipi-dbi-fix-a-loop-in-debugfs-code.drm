Subject: [PATCH 035/690] drm/mipi-dbi: fix a loop in debugfs code
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This code will likely crash if we try to do a zero byte write.  The code
looks like this:

        /* strip trailing whitespace */
        for (i = count - 1; i > 0; i--)
                if (isspace(buf[i]))
			...

We're writing zero bytes so count = 0.  You would think that "count - 1"
would be negative one, but because "i" is unsigned it is a large
positive numer instead.  The "i > 0" condition is true and the "buf[i]"
access will be out of bounds.

The fix is to make "i" signed and now everything works as expected.  The
upper bound of "count" is capped in __kernel_write() at MAX_RW_COUNT so
we don't have to worry about it being higher than INT_MAX.
