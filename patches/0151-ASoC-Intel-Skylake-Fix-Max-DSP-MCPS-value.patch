Subject: [PATCH 151/292] ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix Max DSP MCPS value

Currently Max MCPS is specified as 30M, but it should be 350M.
However actual MCPS is 400M, since module CPS are simulated on
HW and it's peak MCPS is taken into count instead of average cycle
count. So it is limited to 350M to avoid MCPS overshooting.
