Subject: [PATCH 41/42] net: stmmac: Ensure tx function is not running in
 stmmac_xdp_release()

When stmmac_xdp_release() is called, there is a possibility that tx
function is still running on other queues which will lead to tx queue
timed out and reset adapter.

This commit ensure that tx function is not running xdp before release
flow continue to run.
