Subject: [PATCH 0984/4530] drm/omap: cleanup OMAP_BO_SCANOUT use

omap_gem_new() has a comment about OMAP_BO_SCANOUT which does not make
sense. Also, for the TILER case, we drop OMAP_BO_SCANOUT flag for some
reason.

It's not clear what the original purpose of OMAP_BO_SCANOUT is, but
presuming it means "scanout buffer, something that can be consumed by
DSS", this patch cleans up the above issues.
