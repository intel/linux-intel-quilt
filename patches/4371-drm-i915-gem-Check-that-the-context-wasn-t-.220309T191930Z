Subject: [PATCH 4371/4530] drm/i915/gem: Check that the context wasn't closed
 during setup

As setup takes a long time, the user may close the context during the
construction of the execbuf. In order to make sure we correctly track
all outstanding work with non-persistent contexts, we need to serialise
the submission with the context closure and mop up any leaks.
