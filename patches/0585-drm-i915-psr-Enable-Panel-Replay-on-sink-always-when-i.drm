Subject: [PATCH 0585/1107] drm/i915/psr: Enable Panel Replay on sink always
 when it's supported
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Currently we are configuring Panel Replay on sink when it get's
enabled. This means we need to do full modeset when enabling Panel
Replay. This is required as DP specification is saying sink Panel Replay
needs to be configured before link training. Avoid full modeset by enabling
Panel Replay on sink always when it's supported by the sink and the
source.
