Subject: [PATCH 1125/4530] drm/ttm: factor out ttm_bo_mmap_vma_setup
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Factor out ttm vma setup to a new function.
Reduces code duplication a bit.

v2: don't change vm_flags (moved to separate patch).
v4: make ttm_bo_mmap_vma_setup static.
