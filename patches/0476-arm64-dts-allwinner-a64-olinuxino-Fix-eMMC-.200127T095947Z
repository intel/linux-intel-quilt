Subject: [PATCH 476/777] arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: olinuxino: Fix eMMC
 supply regulator

commit 8467ebbf708e5c4574b4eb5f663558fc724945ac upstream.

A64-OLinuXino-eMMC uses 1.8V for eMMC supply. This is done via a triple
jumper, which sets VCC-PL to either 1.8V or 3.3V. This setting is different
for boards with and without eMMC.

This is not a big issue for DDR52 mode, however the eMMC will not work in
HS200/HS400, since these modes explicitly requires 1.8V.

Fixes: 94f68f3a4b2a ("arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Add A64 OlinuXino board (with eMMC)")
