The DRM and KMS frameworks and helpers gain more and more kunit
coverage, so let's document what our expectations are.

+KUnit Coverage Rules
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+KUnit support is gradually added to the DRM framework and helpers. There's no
+general requirement for the framework and helpers to have KUnit tests at the
+moment. However, patches that are affecting a function or helper already
+covered by KUnit tests must provide tests if the change calls for one.
