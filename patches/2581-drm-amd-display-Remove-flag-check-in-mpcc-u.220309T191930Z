Subject: [PATCH 2581/4530] drm/amd/display: Remove flag check in mpcc update

[Why]
MPCC programming was being missed during certain split pipe enables due
to full_update flag not being true. This caused a momentary flash on
half the screen. After discussion, determined we should not have that
flag check within update_mpcc, as it should always perform full
programming when called.

[How]
Remove flag check. We call update_blending within insert_plane, so we
do not need to replace its call from the if block.
