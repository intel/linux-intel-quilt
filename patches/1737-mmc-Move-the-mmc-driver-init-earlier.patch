Subject: [PATCH 1737/2302] mmc: Move the mmc driver init earlier

When doing some boot time optimization for an eMMC rootfs NUCs, we found the rootfs may spend around 100 microseconds waiting for eMMC card to be initialized, then the rootfs could be mounted.

	[    1.216561] Waiting for root device /dev/mmcblk1p1...
	[    1.289262] mmc1: new HS400 MMC card at address 0001
	[    1.289667] mmcblk1: mmc1:0001 R1J56L 14.7 GiB
	[    1.289772] mmcblk1boot0: mmc1:0001 R1J56L partition 1 8.00 MiB
	[    1.289869] mmcblk1boot1: mmc1:0001 R1J56L partition 2 8.00 MiB
	[    1.289967] mmcblk1rpmb: mmc1:0001 R1J56L partition 3 4.00 MiB
	[    1.292798]  mmcblk1: p1 p2 p3
	[    1.300576] EXT4-fs (mmcblk1p1): couldn't mount as ext3 due to feature incompatibilities
	[    1.300912] EXT4-fs (mmcblk1p1): couldn't mount as ext2 due to feature incompatibilities

And this is a common problem for smartphones, tablets, embedded devices and automotive products. This patch will make the eMMC/SD card  start initializing earlier, by changing its order in drivers/Makefile.

On our platform, the waiting for eMMC card is almost eliminated with the patch, which is critical for boot time optimization.
