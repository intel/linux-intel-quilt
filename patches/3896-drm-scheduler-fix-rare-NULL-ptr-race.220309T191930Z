Subject: [PATCH 3896/4530] drm/scheduler: fix rare NULL ptr race
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

There is one one corner case at dma_fence_signal_locked
which will raise the NULL pointer problem just like below.
->dma_fence_signal
    ->dma_fence_signal_locked
	->test_and_set_bit
here trigger dma_fence_release happen due to the zero of fence refcount.

->dma_fence_put
    ->dma_fence_release
	->drm_sched_fence_release_scheduled
	    ->call_rcu
here make the union fled “cb_list” at finished fence
to NULL because struct rcu_head contains two pointer
which is same as struct list_head cb_list

Therefore, to hold the reference of finished fence at drm_sched_process_job
to prevent the null pointer during finished fence dma_fence_signal

v2: hold the finished fence at drm_sched_process_job instead of
    amdgpu_fence_process
v3: resume the blank line
