Subject: [PATCH 3693/4530] drm/nouveau/disp/nv50-: prevent oops when no
 channel method map provided

The implementations for most channel types contains a map of methods to
priv registers in order to provide debugging info when a disp exception
has been raised.

This info is missing from the implementation of PIO channels as they're
rather simplistic already, however, if an exception is raised by one of
them, we'd end up triggering a NULL-pointer deref.  Not ideal...
