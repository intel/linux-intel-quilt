Subject: [PATCH 168/286] ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix FW logging data corruption

As per the new logging scheme introduced in latest firmware,
the log buffer read/write pointers are located at the base
of the log buffer for each core. Hence, while reading log data
during buffer wrap around, the data count needs to be decremented
to skip these pointers. This patch fixes the issue.
