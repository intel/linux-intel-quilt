Subject: [PATCH 2216/2278] x86/intel_rdt: CBM overlap should also check for
 overlap with CDP peer

The CBM overlap test is used to manage the allocations of RDT resources
where overlap is possible between resource groups. When a resource group
is in exclusive mode then there should be no overlap between resource
groups.

The current overlap test only considers overlap between the same
resources, for example, that usage of a RDT_RESOURCE_L2DATA resource
in one resource group does not overlap with usage of a RDT_RESOURCE_L2DATA
resource in another resource group. The problem with this is that it
allows overlap between a RDT_RESOURCE_L2DATA resource in one resource
group with a RDT_RESOURCE_L2CODE resource in another resource group -
even if both resource groups are in exclusive mode. This is a problem
because even though these appear to be different resources they end up
sharing the same underlying hardware and thus does not fulfill the
user's request for exclusive use of hardware resources.

Fix this by including the CDP peer (if there is one) in every CBM
overlap test. This does not impact the overlap between resources
within the same exclusive resource group that is allowed.
