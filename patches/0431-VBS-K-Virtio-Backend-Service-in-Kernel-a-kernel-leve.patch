Subject: [PATCH 0431/1240] VBS-K (Virtio Backend Service in Kernel): a
 kernel-level virtio framework for Clearwater Pass hypervisor.

This patch added the basic VBS-K framework including the following:
 - Definitions of the data structures shared between VBS-K and its
   counterpart in userspace, which is VBS-U;
 - VBS-K device common data structures;
 - Core runtime control logic of the VBS-K framework;
