Subject: [PATCH 0744/1606] drm/doc: Document kapi doc expectations

We've had this already for anything new. With my drm_prime.c cleanup I
also think documentation for everything already existing is complete,
and we can bake this in as a requirements subsystem wide.

v2: Improve wording a bit (Laurent), fix typo in commit message (Sam).

+Documentation Requirements for kAPI
+-----------------------------------
+
+All kernel APIs exported to other modules must be documented, including their
+datastructures and at least a short introductory section explaining the overall
+concepts. Documentation should be put into the code itself as kerneldoc comments
+as much as reasonable.
+
+Do not blindly document everything, but document only what's relevant for driver
+authors: Internal functions of drm.ko and definitely static functions should not
+have formal kerneldoc comments. Use normal C comments if you feel like a comment
+is warranted. You may use kerneldoc syntax in the comment, but it shall not
+start with a /** kerneldoc marker. Similar for data structures, annotate
+anything entirely private with ``/* private: */`` comments as per the
+documentation guide.

-Add missing kerneldoc for exported functions
---------------------------------------------
-
-The DRM reference documentation is still lacking kerneldoc in a few areas. The
-task would be to clean up interfaces like moving functions around between
-files to better group them and improving the interfaces like dropping return
-values for functions that never fail. Then write kerneldoc for all exported
-functions and an overview section and integrate it all into the drm book.
-
-See https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/ for what's there already.
