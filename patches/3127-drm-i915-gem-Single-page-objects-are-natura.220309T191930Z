Subject: [PATCH 3127/4530] drm/i915/gem: Single page objects are naturally
 contiguous

Small objects that only occupy a single page are naturally contiguous,
so mark them as such and allow them the special abilities that come with
it.

A more thorough treatment would extend i915_gem_object_pin_map() to
support discontiguous lmem objects, following the example of
ioremap_prot() and use get_vm_area() + remap_io_sg().
