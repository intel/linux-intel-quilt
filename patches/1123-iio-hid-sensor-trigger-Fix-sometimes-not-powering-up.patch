Subject: [PATCH 1123/1240] iio: hid-sensor-trigger: Fix sometimes not powering
 up the sensor after resume

hid_sensor_set_power_work() powers the sensors back up after a resume
based on the user_requested_state atomic_t.

But hid_sensor_power_state() treats this as a boolean flag, leading to
the following problematic scenario:

1) Some app starts using the iio-sensor in buffered / triggered mode,
   hid_sensor_data_rdy_trigger_set_state(true) gets called, setting
   user_requested_state to 1.
2) Something directly accesses a _raw value through sysfs, leading
   to a call to hid_sensor_power_state(true) followed by
   hid_sensor_power_state(false) call, this sets user_requested_state
   to 1 followed by setting it to 0.
3) Suspend/resume the machine, hid_sensor_set_power_work() now does
   NOT power the sensor back up because user_requested_state (wrongly)
   is 0. Which stops the app using the sensor in buffered mode from
   receiving any new values.

This commit changes user_requested_state to a counter tracking how many
times hid_sensor_power_state(true) was called instead, fixing this.
