Subject: [PATCH 070/777] cfg80211: fix double-free after changing network
 namespace
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ Upstream commit 56cb31e185adb61f930743a9b70e700a43625386 ]

If wdev->wext.keys was initialized it didn't get reset to NULL on
unregister (and it doesn't get set in cfg80211_init_wdev either), but
wdev is reused if unregister was triggered through
cfg80211_switch_netns.

The next unregister (for whatever reason) will try to free
wdev->wext.keys again.
