Subject: [PATCH 3807/4530] drm/i915/dsc: force full modeset whenever DSC is
 enabled at probe

We lack full state readout of DSC config, which may lead to DSC enable
using a config that's all zeros, failing spectacularly. Force full
modeset and thus compute config at probe to get a sane state, until we
implement DSC state readout. Any fastset that did appear to work with
DSC at probe, worked by coincidence. [1] is an example of a change that
triggered the issue on TGL DSI DSC.
