Subject: [PATCH 076/777] powerpc/spinlocks: Include correct header for static
 key
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 6da3eced8c5f3b03340b0c395bacd552c4d52411 upstream.

Recently, the spinlock implementation grew a static key optimization,
but the jump_label.h header include was left out, leading to build
errors:

  linux/arch/powerpc/include/asm/spinlock.h:44:7: error: implicit declaration of function ‘static_branch_unlikely’
   44 |  if (!static_branch_unlikely(&shared_processor))

This commit adds the missing header.

mpe: The build break is only seen with CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL=n.

Fixes: 656c21d6af5d ("powerpc/shared: Use static key to detect shared processor")
