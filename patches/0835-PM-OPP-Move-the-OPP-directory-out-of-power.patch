Subject: [PATCH 0835/2345] PM / OPP: Move the OPP directory out of power/

The drivers/base/power/ directory is special and contains code related
to power management core like system suspend/resume, hibernation, etc.
It was fine to keep the OPP code inside it when we had just one file for
it, but it is growing now and already has a directory for itself.

Lets move it directly under drivers/ directory, just like cpufreq and
cpuidle.
