Basic helpers have been extracted, now there's a pile more todo still
across the entire tree.

+Backlight Refactoring
+---------------------
+
+Backlight drivers have a triple enable/disable state, which is a bit overkill.
+Plan to fix this:
+
+1. Roll out backlight_enable() and backlight_disable() helpers everywhere. This
+   has started already.
+2. In all, only look at one of the three status bits set by the above helpers.
+3. Remove the other two status bits.

 Tinydrm is the helper driver for really simple fb drivers. The goal is to make
 those drivers as simple as possible, so lots of room for refactoring:
 
-- backlight helpers, probably best to put them into a new drm_backlight.c.
-  This is because drivers/video is de-facto unmaintained. We could also
-  move drivers/video/backlight to drivers/gpu/backlight and take it all
-  over within drm-misc, but that's more work. Backlight helpers require a fair
-  bit of reworking and refactoring. A simple example is the enabling of a backlight.
-  Tinydrm has helpers for this. It would be good if other drivers can also use the
-  helper. However, there are various cases we need to consider i.e different
-  drivers seem to have different ways of enabling/disabling a backlight.
-  We also need to consider the backlight drivers (like gpio_backlight). The situation
-  is further complicated by the fact that the backlight is tied to fbdev
-  via fb_notifier_callback() which has complicated logic. For further details, refer
-  to the following discussion thread:

 - spi helpers, probably best put into spi core/helper code. Thierry said
   the spi maintainer is fast&reactive, so shouldn't be a big issue.
