Subject: [PATCH 076/108] REVERTME: Workaround for TSN AIC driver unload issue

Temporary disables CONFIG_HWMON in marvell10g.c

While during driver unload, kernel will call to mv3310_hwmon_disable()
to disable the thermal monitoring, but at that moment, the phydev
already been deleted at the earlier stage.

Then, it will causes the unsuccessful unload and showing dump stack
because the kernel was not able to handle NULL pointer.
