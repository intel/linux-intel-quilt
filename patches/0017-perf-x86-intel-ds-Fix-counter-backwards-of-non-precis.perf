Subject: [PATCH 17/19] perf/x86/intel/ds: Fix counter backwards of non-precise
 events counters-snapshotting

The counter backwards may be observed in the PMI handler when
counters-snapshotting some non-precise events in the freq mode.

For the non-precise events, it's possible the counters-snapshotting
records a positive value for an overflowed PEBS event. Then the HW
auto-reload mechanism reset the counter to 0 immediately. Because the
pebs_event_reset is cleared in the freq mode, which doesn't set the
PERF_X86_EVENT_AUTO_RELOAD.
In the PMI handler, 0 will be read rather than the positive value
recorded in the counters-snapshotting record.

The counters-snapshotting case has to be specially handled. Since the
event value has been updated when processing the counters-snapshotting
record, only needs to set the new period for the counter via
x86_pmu_set_period().
