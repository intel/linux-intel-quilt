Subject: [PATCH 18/19] perf/x86: Remove helper perf_events_lapic_init() from
 x86_pmu_enable()

The helper perf_events_lapic_init() mainly writes APIC_LVTPC MSR to
configure PMI to NMI and clear MASK bit, but it seems unnecessary to
call it in x86_pmu_enable(). perf_events_lapic_init() is already called
by init_hw_perf_events() and MASK bit would be always cleared in PMI
interrupt handler.

Since x86_pmu_enable() could be called very frequently in some high
context-switch cases, the performance overhead from APIC_LVTPC write
could not be ignored especially in Guest environment.

For example, the Geekbench performance in perf-stat multiplexing case
increases 1% and perf-sched benchmark performance increases 7% in Guest
environment after removing perf_events_lapic_init() from
x86_pmu_enable().
