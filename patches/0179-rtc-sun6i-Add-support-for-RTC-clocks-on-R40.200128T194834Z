Subject: [PATCH 179/777] rtc: sun6i: Add support for RTC clocks on R40

commit 111bf02b8f544f98de53ea1f912ae01f598b161b upstream.

When support for the R40 in the rtc-sun6i driver was split out for a
separate compatible string, only the RTC half was covered, and not the
clock half. Unfortunately this results in the whole driver not working,
as the RTC half expects the clock half to have been initialized.

Add support for the clock part as well. The clock part is like the H3,
but does not need to export the internal oscillator, nor does it have
a gateable LOSC external output.

This fixes issues with WiFi and Bluetooth not working on the BPI M2U.

Fixes: d6624cc75021 ("rtc: sun6i: Add R40 compatible")
