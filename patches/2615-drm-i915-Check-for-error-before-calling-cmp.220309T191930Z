Subject: [PATCH 2615/4530] drm/i915: Check for error before calling cmpxchg()

Only do the locked compare of the existing fence->error if we actually
need to set an error. As we tend to call i915_sw_fence_set_error_once()
unconditionally, it saves on typing to put the common has-error check
into the inline.
