Subject: [PATCH 1/5] ACPI: battery: use cache_time as cache "enabled"

When battery state is not cached the module parameter cache_time is 0
and battery->update_time starts at 0. However, it set to jiffies in
each call to acpi_battery_get_state() and should not be used to
determine if a cache time is used.

Using battery->update_time causes the evaluation of time_before()
even though cache_time is 0.

This is a minor issue as the behavior is still as expected.
Even if kernel HZ was very slow and jiffies remained equal, the
expected branch (false) would be taken because time_before() is
used instead of time_before_eq().
