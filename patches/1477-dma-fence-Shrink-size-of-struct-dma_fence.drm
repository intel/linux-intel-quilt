Subject: [PATCH 1477/1606] dma-fence: Shrink size of struct dma_fence
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Rearrange the couple of 32-bit atomics hidden amongst the field of
pointers that unnecessarily caused the compiler to insert some padding,
shrinks the size of the base struct dma_fence from 80 to 72 bytes on
x86-64.
