Subject: [PATCH 119/144] kernel/vhm:Add some debugs to print the client
 id/name for create/destroy ioreq_client

Currently the client id is printed when one ioreq_client is created.
But it is difficult to know who is using the client based on client_id.
The client name is meaningful. At the same time the info is also printed
when ioreq client is destroyed.
