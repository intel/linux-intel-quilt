Subject: [PATCH 0376/1240] ACPI / PM: Restore acpi_subsys_complete()

Commit 58a1fbbb2ee8 (PM / PCI / ACPI: Kick devices that might have
been reset by firmware), made PCI's and ACPI's ->complete() callbacks
to be assigned to a new API called pm_complete_with_resume_check(),
which was introduced in the same change.

Later it turned out that using pm_complete_with_resume_check() wasn't
good enough for PCI, as it needed additional PCI specific checks,
before deciding whether runtime resuming the device is needed when
running the ->complete() callback.

This leaves ACPI as the only user of pm_complete_with_resume_check().
Therefore let's restore ACPI's acpi_subsys_complete(), which was
dropped in commit 58a1fbbb2ee8 (PM / PCI / ACPI: Kick devices that
might have been reset by firmware).

This enables us to remove the pm_complete_with_resume_check() API in
a following change, but it also enables ACPI to add more ACPI
specific checks in acpi_subsys_complete() if that turns out to be
necessary.
