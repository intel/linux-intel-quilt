Subject: [PATCH 450/777] ARM: dts: meson8: fix the size of the PMU registers

commit 46c9585ed4af688ff1be6d4e76d7ed2f04de4fba upstream.

The PMU registers are at least 0x18 bytes wide. Meson8b already uses a
size of 0x18. The structure of the PMU registers on Meson8 and Meson8b
is similar but not identical.

Meson8 and Meson8b have the following registers in common (starting at
AOBUS + 0xe0):
  #define AO_RTI_PWR_A9_CNTL0 0xe0 (0x38 << 2)
  #define AO_RTI_PWR_A9_CNTL1 0xe4 (0x39 << 2)
  #define AO_RTI_GEN_PWR_SLEEP0 0xe8 (0x3a << 2)
  #define AO_RTI_GEN_PWR_ISO0 0x4c (0x3b << 2)

Meson8b additionally has these three registers:
  #define AO_RTI_GEN_PWR_ACK0 0xf0 (0x3c << 2)
  #define AO_RTI_PWR_A9_MEM_PD0 0xf4 (0x3d << 2)
  #define AO_RTI_PWR_A9_MEM_PD1 0xf8 (0x3e << 2)

Thus we can assume that the register size of the PMU IP blocks is
identical on both SoCs (and Meson8 just contains some reserved registers
in that area) because the CEC registers start right after the PMU
(AO_RTI_*) registers at AOBUS + 0x100 (0x40 << 2).

The upcoming power domain driver will need to read and write the
AO_RTI_GEN_PWR_SLEEP0 and AO_RTI_GEN_PWR_ISO0 registers, so the updated
size is needed for that driver to work.
