Subject: [PATCH 2206/2278] x86/intel_rdt: Fix incorrect loop end condition

In order to determine a sane default cache allocation for a new CAT/CDP
resource group, all resource groups are checked to determine which cache
portions are available to share. At this time all possible CLOSIDs
that can be supported by the resource is checked. This is problematic
if the resource supports more CLOSIDs than another CAT/CDP resource. In
this case, the number of CLOSIDs that could be allocated are fewer than
the number of CLOSIDs that can be supported by the resource.

Limit the check of closids to that what is supported by the system based
on the minimum across all resources.

Fixes: 95f0b77ef ("x86/intel_rdt: Initialize new resource group with sane defaults")
