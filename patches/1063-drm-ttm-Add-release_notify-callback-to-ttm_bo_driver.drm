Subject: [PATCH 1063/1606] drm/ttm: Add release_notify callback to
 ttm_bo_driver
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This notifies the driver that a BO is about to be released.

Releasing a BO also invokes the move_notify callback from
ttm_bo_cleanup_memtype_use, but that happens too late for anything
that would add fences to the BO and require a delayed delete.
