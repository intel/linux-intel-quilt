Subject: [PATCH 0928/1240] [INTERNAL] drm/i915: Repair the preemption context
 if hit by reset

It is possible for the preemption context to be active on an engine
when the engine is reset. The preemption context is not tracked via
the request mechanism, so the normal reset handling will not detect
this scenario and will not be able to fixup possible context
corruption. So add some extra logic to do this.

This patch is required to support the force preemption feature.
There are a series of patches upstream which insulate the preemption
context from corruption, making this repair unecessary. However it
is an extensive backport that modifies other functionality and is
a bit risky. So this simple point fix seems the better option.

Test: Run IGT gem_exec_fpreempt repeatedly.
